List of Differentiating Features

1. Email Sending
   
	We use the Gmail API on the backend to send emails.

	When a user's package is delivered, he or she will receive an email telling them where the package corresponding to a specific trackingid is delivered.


2. Shopping Cart

	We implemented the front-end shopping cart function so that users can purchase more than one product at once.

	The items in the shopping cart can be dynamically increased or decreased. The items in the order are not determined until the user places an order.

	Users can see the existing items in their shopping cart in real time.

3. Showing Details

	The user can view the status and order details of all his or her orders.

	In the order status interface, users can click View Details to see all the products included in this order.
	
	The order details page will display product pictures, tracking ID, shipping location, product description and quantity.

4. Closest Warehouse Allocation

	When a user places an order, we will hand it over to the warehouse closest to the user's delivery address for quick delivery.
	
5. Associated with UPS

	If the user provides a UPS account when placing an order, he or she can see all orders associated with this UPS account on the UPS official website.

6. Navigation Bar

	We provide a navigation bar to facilitate users to switch between the order placing interface, order status viewing interface, and logout.
